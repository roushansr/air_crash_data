A data project that scrapes and analyzes global aviation accident data from the Aviation Safety Network (ASN). The project includes scraping historical crash data, cleaning and transforming the data, and visualizing key insights like trends and KPIs.
## Folder Structure

- `data/raw`: Raw data files
- `data/processed`: Cleaned/processed data files
- `notebook`: Jupyter notebooks for scraping & transformation
- `scripts`: Python scripts (if needed)

## Tools

- Python (Pandas, Requests, BeautifulSoup)
- Power BI for visualization

## Objectives
Hereâ€™s a clear list of objectives for this project:

1.Collect comprehensive air crash data from 1919 to 2025 using automated web scraping.
2.Handle multi-page navigation for each year to ensure no data is missed.
3.Clean and structure the extracted data into a well-organized Excel format.
4.Analyze and Vizualize

## About the website and Data
Link : https://asn.flightsafety.org/database/
This is the Aviation Safety Network website.
The ASN accident database is updated daily and contains descriptions of over 23,000 airliner (aircraft originally certified to carry 12 or more passengers), military transport category aircraft, and corporate jet aircraft accidents dating back to 1919. The information is primarily derived from official governmental agencies, such as air accident investigation boards and civil aviation authorities.
